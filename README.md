The repository accompanies *Matlock, W. and Lipworth, S. et al. Enterobacterales* plasmid sharing amongst human bloodstream infections, livestock, wastewater, and waterway niches in Oxfordshire, UK. eLife. 2023 12:e85302. doi: https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.85302*

- Shell scripts (those ending in `.sh`) are formatted for a Slurm scheduler, but they also record the parameters used for any tools.
- If you want help/other materials (e.g., any plotting scripts), please don't hesitate to get in touch! ðŸ˜Š
